"""EXERCISE 4 - Evaluator-Optimizer on your own task.   (about 25 minutes)

Pick a writing task from your own life - a leave letter, an internship cover
note, a project abstract, an event invitation - and define FOUR criteria.

At least one criterion must be OBJECTIVELY CHECKABLE (a word count, a required
phrase, a banned word). Vague criteria produce an evaluator that approves
everything, which costs you double for nothing.

CHECKPOINT
  [ ] Passes in 1-2 rounds with sensible criteria
  [ ] With one impossible criterion, stops at the cap and returns passed=False
  [ ] With vague criteria, approves immediately - observe it, and explain why
